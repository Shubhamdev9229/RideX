# RideX

RideX is a web application designed to facilitate ride-sharing services.
The project is structured with separate directories for the frontend and backend components, indicating a full-stack application approach.

## Project Structure

```
RideX/
├── backend/
└── frontend/
```

- **backend/**: Contains the server-side code, potentially handling APIs, database interactions, and authentication mechanisms.
- **frontend/**: Holds the client-side code, likely built with modern JavaScript frameworks or libraries to provide an interactive user interface.

## Features

While specific features are not detailed in the repository, typical functionalities for a ride-sharing application like RideX might include:

- **User Authentication**: Registration and login for riders and drivers.
- **Ride Booking**: Users can request rides, and drivers can accept them.
- **Real-time Tracking**: Track rides in real-time using map integrations.
- **Payment Integration**: Secure payment processing for completed rides.
- **Rating System**: Allow users to rate each other post-ride.

## Getting Started

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your machine.
- Package manager like npm or yarn.

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Shubhamdev9229/RideX.git
   cd RideX
   ```

2. **Install backend dependencies**:

   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm install
   ```

3. **Install frontend dependencies**:

   ```bash
   cd ../frontend
   npm install
   ```

### Running the Application

1. **Start the backend server**:

   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm start
   ```

2. **Start the frontend development server**:

   ```bash
   cd ../frontend
   npm start
   ```

The frontend should now be accessible at `http://localhost:3000` (or another port if specified), and it will communicate with the backend server for API requests.
